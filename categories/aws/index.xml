      <description>In level 1, we discovered that the homepage http://flaws.cloud is hosted in an S3 bucket with Amazons static page feature. Since the creator of the bucket configured the permissions such that unauthenticated users could list it, we discovered a secret file named &amp;ldquo;secret-dd02c7c.html&amp;rdquo;. It lead us to the start page of level 2. Now, the level description says we have to do something similar, but need our own AWS account this time.</description>

      <description>Adoption of cloud computing is rising rapidly. Studies predict it will soon surpass on-premises hosting also for enterprise workloads.

For example, many companies misconfigure AWS S3 bucket permissions and leave sensitive data unprotected.</description>
