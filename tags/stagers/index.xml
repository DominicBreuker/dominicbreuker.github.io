      <description>Sliver C2 This post is part of a tutorial blog post series on Sliver C2 (v1.5.16). For an overview: click here.
Introduction The previous post introduced basic custom stagers which run a Sliver implant within the stager process. Real malware however often injects a malicious payload into already existing processes for various reasons. The goal may be to bypass protection mechanisms or to avoid detection. For example, a browser process might be allowed to connect to the internet while other processes get blocked, or even if all processes are allowed, it may look less suspicious if it&amp;rsquo;s a browser doing that.</description>

Introduction Sliver C2 implants will often be delivered with a small script or program called a &amp;ldquo;stager&amp;rdquo;. Such a program downloads implant shellcode from a remote location, such as the C2 server, and then runs the shellcode. At first sight, this sounds unnecessarily complicated. Why not execute the implant directly instead of a stager?</description>
