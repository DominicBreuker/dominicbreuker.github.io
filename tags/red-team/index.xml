      <description>Sliver C2 Introduction Recently, I developed some interest into red teaming and wanted to try out a few things. As you might know, all of that is no fun without a command and control (C2) framework. Unfortunately, most of the well-known ones are terribly expensive (Cobalt Strike or SCYTHE). Not good for a few personal experiments at home.
Fortunately though, there are plenty of open source solution out there. Check out the C2 matrix and you get more choices than you can handle.</description>
