      <description>A while ago I was writing an application based on the Rails framework which returned sanitized user input. Its purpose was to build a PoC for an XSS vulnerability in the Rails HTML sanitizer (CVE-2022-32209, which appeared in June 2022). The following is a short write-up of that endeavour and how it turned into the discovery of two additional CVEs.
I start with a discussion of the original CVE-2022-32209, proceed with an investigation of the fix and how it turned out to be incomplete (CVE-2022-23520), explain how that motivated additional fuzzing which uncovered additional working attack payloads (CVE-2022-23519) and conclude with a brief outline of the fix (entirely designed and implemented by flavorjones).</description>
