      <description>Sliver C2 This post is part of a tutorial blog post series on Sliver C2. For an overview: click here. I originally wrote this based on Sliver v1.5.16, which contained a few bugs. As of March 6 2023, all content below is now updated to v1.5.34 where some bugs are removed.
Introduction If you went through the previous posts, you should be familiar with the C2 protocols and be able to write a basic stager for Sliver implants that runs even if AV is on.</description>
